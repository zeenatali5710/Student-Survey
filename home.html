                <h3>Computer Science and Electrical Engineering Department</h3> aims to maintain a program of excellence in teaching, research, and service for all of its programs.  <h4>At the undergraduate level, </h4> we will provide students with a firm foundation of both the theory and practice of Computer Science and Computer Engineering.  Our curricula also give students the social, ethical, and liberal education needed to make significant contributions to society.  Students receiving a bachelor’s degree are ready to enter the work force as productive computer scientists or computer engineers, or to continue their education at the graduate or professional level.</h4>
            </p>
            <p>
                <h4>At the graduate level,</h4> we are committed to developing the research and professional capabilities of students in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Cybersecurity.  Our programs provide a deeper mastery of the basics of these fields, as well as opportunities to collaborate on leading-edge research with our faculty.  Our faculty are engaged in both practical and theoretical research, often in partnership with government agencies, private industry and non-governmental organizations. The aim of this research is to advance knowledge within our disciplines and also to contribute to solving problems faced by our society.
